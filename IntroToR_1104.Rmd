# Today

.pull-left[

**Your profile**
- Interest in learning R (or other ways to use it).  


**Goals of today**

- Identify the parts of RStudio
- Be able to load and download data
- Feel comfortable using R
- Hopefully we will cover all the topics

**Pauses and questions**

- There will be several pauses
- You can stop me to ask questions or
- Questions can be made [at this link too `r fa("external-link-alt", fill = "#f2cc8f")`]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uG7a2_hkdaKQm5gKXRBFf6gcyoUBan2e69gL3ZKcwg8/edit?usp=sharing)

# Lets begging!

---

name: install-r

# 1. Install R

First time installing R

To install R and Rstudio you can visit the page [posit `r fa("external-link-alt", fill = "#f2cc8f")` ](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=280}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"002Posit.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## First time installing R

Once you click download and install R, you will find several links.

If you are the first time installing you likely need to choose the first link.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"003LoadR.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## Update R

If you already have R and R-Studio

Check which version of R you are using:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```

To see if you need to update you can use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("installr")
library(installr)
updateR()
```

<br>

**Do you need an update?**
  
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=150}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"003UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```


---

## Update R

If you opt to update R, one way to do it is going to the [installation page `r fa("external-link-alt", fill = "#f2cc8f")`](https://www.r-project.org/)

You will likely select >4.3 (in 2023)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"004UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## Update R

If you decide to update your R, its better to do it in the Rgui and not R-Studio

.pull-left[
Open Rgui
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=150}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"005UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```
Once in the Rgui, write updateR()

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=200}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"006UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Give it some time

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=200}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"007UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```

]

---

## Update R

Select YES if you already had R packages installed in your previous version, and do not want to install each package one by one again.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=100}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"008UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```

<br>

<br>

By March 2023 4.2.3 was the newest version of R.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=100}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"009UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```


**Did you notice the difference?**

---

## Update R-Studio

One thing is updating R and another one to update R-Studio

If you already have Rstudio and want to see if you need to update you can go to:

.pull-left[
Help>Check for updates

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"010UpdateRStudio.png?raw=true"))
```
]
.pull-right[
Outdated

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=100}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"011UpdateRStudio.png?raw=true"))
```

Up to date

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=100}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"012UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```
]

## Parts of R

---

## 2. What is R?

R is a programming language developed for statistical analyses by the Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (New Zealand) in 1996.

## 2.2 Why  R?

.pull-left[
**Advantages**

- Its free

- A lot of tools

- Flexible data visualization

**For science, is reproducible**

- You can save all the steps you followed, making it verifiable 

- Instead of clicking on buttons the instructions can be save in sequence, helping save time and reduce errors


]

--

.pull-right[
**Disadvantages**

- Has a learning curve  

- It is like learning a new language

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height=200}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"014LearningCurve.jpg?raw=true"))
```

]

---

## 2.3. R vs RStudio.

What are the differences between R and RStudio?  

**R** is the programming language.  
**RStudio** is an IDE:  Integrated Development Environment.  

.pull-left[
R is the motor  
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=250}
knitr::include_graphics("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1663581254798-987e1f876ea2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1974&q=80")
```
]

.pull-right[
RStudio is the stirring wheel  
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=250}
knitr::include_graphics("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1667057227564-790470f7a855?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8Mnx8c3RpcnJpbmclMjB3aGVlbHxlbnwwfHwwfHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60")
```
]

---

## 2.4 Using R

First time opening RStudio looks like this:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=350}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"019Rparts.png?raw=true"))
```

To have a code editor:

Open:  
File > New File > Rscript

---

## 2.4. Using RStudio.

In the **source** section the code can be edited and saved.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=350}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"020Rparts.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## 2.4. Using RStudio.

To change the order of the panes, you can change the pane layout

.pull-left[

Click on the squares >  

Or in Tools> Global Options

select **Pane Layout**

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"021PaneLayout.png?raw=true"))
```
]

.pull-right[

Select your preferred order

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"022PaneLayout.png?raw=true"))
```
]

---

## 2.4 Using RStudio

Testing the console

R is like a calculator

- Write in the console
```{r, comment="", eval=FALSE}
3*4
```

- Write in the editor
```{r, comment="", eval=FALSE}
3*4
```

--

In the editor: ctrl + enter

--

- Now write in the editor, dont forget to click ctrl+enter

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Result<-3*4
```

What happend in the **environment**?


---

name: data-types

## 2.5. Data types

Some data types:
- Numeric
```{r, comment=""}
class(1.4)
```

- Characters
```{r, comment=""}
class("Miriam")
```

---

## 2.5. Data types

Why if we use quotes ""?
```{r, comment=""}
class("1")
```

- Logical
```{r}
3 == 4
```

```{r}
3 < 5
```

There are many others, that would be relevant later on.

Source: [Data structures by the Carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/13-supp-data-structures/)

---

## 2.6. Data frame

Assign symbol

```{r, eval=FALSE}
<-
```

This symbol is frequently use, and is important that you find it in your keyboard as soon as possible. 
 

- The equal **=**  might behave differently than the assign symbol <br>
See here: [Assignment operators](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1741820/what-are-the-differences-between-and-assignment-operators-in-r), [R inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf), [Why they are not the same](https://www.roelpeters.be/the-difference-between-arrow-and-equals-assignment-in-r/)   

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=200}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"024Assign.jpg?raw=true"))
```
]

---

## 2.6. Data frame

Lets use the arrow symbol.  
```{r}
Names<-c("Miriam","Jette","Kai","Nele","Jana","Kristin","Karena","Nico","Philipp","Mads")
class(Names)
```

```{r}
Names<-as.data.frame(Names)
class(Names)
```

Now in the **environment** click twice and look at your data frame.

---

## 2.6. Data frame

Assign vectors to a column or check a column contents

The symbol $ is in R 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
$
```

Lets create a new column

```{r}
Names$LastName<-c("G","A","T","D","L","S","H",NA,"M","L")
```

```{r, comment=""}
head(Names,5)
```

---

## 2.7. Force classes

Force column type

```{r}
my_number<-'1'
```

```{r}
class(my_number)
```

```{r}
my_number<-as.numeric(my_number)
```

```{r}
class(my_number)
```

---

## 2.7. Force classes

Our favorite class

```{r}
my_timestamp<-'2015-06-12 05:00:00'
```

```{r}
class(my_timestamp)
```

```{r}
my_timestamp <- as.POSIXct(strptime(my_timestamp, "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S "), "GMT")
```

```{r}
class(my_timestamp)
```

Timestamp should be a "POSIXct" "POSIXt" for R to understand the are date and time

---

## 2.8. Code editor

To add text in the **editor** we use the symbol **#** (hashtag)

```{r}
#Here you created a data frame with names, but there is NA
```

R will ignore the text that has a # but these are very important for us to make annotations.

It is a **good practice** to write comments. Either for us to share the script, or for you to remember what you were doing.

This is specially important if you get corrections, or if you want to repeat the analyses.

# Errors


---

## 2.9. Type of errors

Errors are part of life.  
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=100, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"025Spongebob.gif"))
```

R very often is trying to tell us how to solve the error.

- For example:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
3 = 4
```
Error in 3 = 4 :left-hand side to assignment (do_set)


Other messages that might be red or orange are:
- Warnings, I will do it, but Im not responsible of what you are doing.
- Messages, hey I just want to let you know this happend.

---

## 2.9. The most common errors

Whats going on here

Remove the # and find the error.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
#c("Miriam","Bety","Angel","Denise""Pamela")
```

--

- Missing a comma

--

```{r}
#c("Alvaro","Gabriela","Juan",,"Lisset")
```

--

- Too many commas

--

```{r}
#c("Majo","Irma","Paulina"
```

--

- Missing a parenthesis

--

```{r}
#c("Majo","Irma,"Paulina")
```

--

- Missing a quote (")

---

## 2.9. Debugging bingo

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=500}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"023DebuggingBingo.jpg?raw=true"))
```

Source: Dr. Ji Son

---

## 2.10. Name consistency

Many errors are going to be marked by a red x in the **code editor**.

--

But many will not.

What is wrong with these?
```{r}
#name
```
--

-  If our goal is to use of data frame from the environment it needs to be written exactly the same **Names**.

--

To reduce this source of error, is important to be consitent on how we name the objects.

Some considerations are:

- R will not take objects that start with a number (Eg."1Names").  
- But the number can be at the end of the name (Eg."Names1").  

- Try to be consistent 
E.g. ("my_names").  
E.g. ("my.names").

# 3. Packages

---

## 3.1. Packages

- Packages are a collection of functions
- Packages are installed one time, but need to be loaded every time you need them.

An analogy is that install.packages() is downloading an app, and library() is like opening the app every time you want to use it.

To install packages using the **workspace**

Go to Packages>Install and write tha name of the package

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=350}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"020Rparts.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## 3.1. Packages

- To install in the **console** write: install.packages("").  
To load a package: library("").  

Some packages that we will use: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("cowsay")
install.packages("here")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

`r emo::ji("clock")` Tidyverse is a compilation of packages, this one might take some time.

Note: It probably will give us a warning, remember that a warning might be just information. In this case is telling us what the package contains.

---

## 3.1. Packages


```{r, eval=FALSE}
say(what = "Now you can download packages!", by = "cat")
```

nothing happend?
We should load the library first.

---

## 3.1. Packages

```{r, comment="", warning=FALSE}
library("cowsay")
say(what = "Now you can download packages!", by = "cat")
```

---


## 3.2. Directories

Where are my files?.  

By hand: Click on the **workspace** > Files > More > Set As Working directory

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=350}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"019Rparts.png?raw=true"))
```

This is practical, but needs to be done every time that we enter R and therefore be time consuming.

---

## 3.2. Directories

Where I am working?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("paste your directory name here")
```

Note, that you will need to copy and paste the directory.

If you share your script or are working in another computer, everyone will have different directories. 

---

## 3.2. Directories

Where I am?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('here')
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(here)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
here()
```

Advantages:
- **here** allows to use the folder where we saved the script
- You can share your script and your collaborators dont need to copy and paste their directory
- If the folder name is changed or the folder is change from place it would still work

# 4. Read files

---

## 4.1. Read files

A typical R project looks like this:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=250}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"031Program.png?raw=true"))
```

.right[
Source: [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)
]

---


## 4.1. Read files

To load data, we will use functions from the package tidyverse.

Do you already have it installed?

```{r, message="FALSE", warning='FALSE'}
library("tidyverse")
```


Also, download files [here](https://github.com/MiriamLL/R_intro/tree/master/Downloads).

- penguins1.csv
- penguins2.csv
- penguins3.txt
- penguins4.xlsx

---

## 4.2. By hand

You can upload data by hand in your workspace

In the **environment** there is a part that says **Import Dataset**

Select the file **penguins1.csv**

--

Another option is to go to the **workspace** 
Files> Click on the file and **import data set**

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=350}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"019Rparts.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## 4.2. csv format

Instead of clicks, we can write in the console or script:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins1<-read_csv("Downloads/penguins1.csv")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(penguins1)
```

---

## 4.2. csv format

Now try opening **penguins2.csv**  

This file instead of being separated by comas, its separated by colons ";"

Therefore, instead of using **read_csv** we will need to use **read_csv2**

To illustrate this issue, try loading the data using **read_csv**.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins2<-read_csv("Downloads/penguins2.csv")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(penguins2)
```


--

Lets try now with **read_csv2**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins2<-read_csv2("Downloads/penguins2.csv")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(penguins2)
```

---

## 4.3.  Other formats

Click on the file **Pingus_3.txt**.  

This one is separated by tabs.  

read_tsv is for reading tab separated values.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins3<-read_tsv("Downloads/penguins3.txt")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(penguins3)
```

---

## 4.4. Excel format

For loading excel data, there is a special package called **readxl**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("readxl")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
penguins4<- read_excel("Downloads/penguins4.xlsx")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(penguins4)
```


---

## 4.5. From an url

Urls (Uniform Resource Locators) or links can also be source of data.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
penguins5<- read_csv('https://github.com/MiriamLL/R_intro/blob/master/Downloads/penguins1.csv')
```

Look at the first 5 rows of the data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(penguins,5)
```

## 4.6. movebank

There is a package called [move](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/move/vignettes/browseMovebank.html) that can be use to access data stored in movebank.

To install:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('move')
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(move)
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
movebankLogin()
```

Add your login, if you have one, at the console.

---

## 4.6 movebank

It is more convenient to store your login information, but you have to be careful to not share the script with your login information.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
loginStored <- movebankLogin(username="MiriamLerma", password="********")
```

```{r,eval=TRUE}
my_study<-'FTZ UCN Kelp Gull Chile'
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
MyGull<-getMovebankLocationData(study=my_study, 
                               individual_local_identifier="KEGU-noband01-Coquimbo",
                               timestamp_start="202212010000000",
                               timestamp_end="20221205000000000",
                               sensorID="GPS")
```


It might give you a warning, but for now that is not important.

---

## 4.7. packages with data

Data can also be stored in packages.  
For example [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguin6<-penguins
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(penguin6)
```

---

## 4.7. packages with data

Moreover, packages with data are not limited to data frames.

---

## 4.7. packages with data

For example, the package GermanNorthSea contains shapefiles

With 6 lines of code you can plot a map (Showing just for illustration purposes)

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MiriamLL/GermanNorthSea")
```

Now the package sf
```{r, message=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
#install.packages('sf')
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(GermanNorthSea)
```

Load and plot some data

```{r}
German_land<-GermanNorthSea::German_land
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot()+ geom_sf(data = German_land, colour = 'black', fill = '#ffffbe')+
  coord_sf(xlim = c(3790000,4250000), ylim = c(3350000,3680000),
                    label_axes = list(top = "E", left = "N", bottom = 'E', right='N'))
```
]

# 5. Rmarkdown

---

## 5.1. RMarkdown 

Rmarkdown is very convenient because it let us export what we do in R to html or word documents.

We can even make slides... <br>
.right[...like this one.]

--

There are **plenty** of options on Rmd. I will just point out a few.

---

## 5.2. Rmd

Markdown is plain text...  
.right[...just as we write in a note block.]

However, the advantages of using Rmd is that you can include a lot of text and thus you can write your **thesis, papers, webpage, books and presentations** without leaving RStudio.

--

Moreover, you can include:  
- code and results that are automatically generated.

---

## 5.2. Rmd

What Rmd does, is that it "translates" what has been written using **PanDoc**.  

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=600}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/61d189fd9cdf955058415d3e1b28dd60e1bd7c9b/b739c/lesson-images/rmarkdownflow.png')
```
]

---


## 5.2. Rmd

We can generate an **output**, that can be read even if you dont have R install.

Just like this presentation.

--

Also, you can get your results without showing the code and without having to copy and paste the results in other program like word.

An example:     

_Here I load my data and check the number of observations_  
```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins7<-penguins
nrow(penguins7) 
```

---

## 5.2. R vs Rmd

**Considerations:  **  
Rmd behaves differently than R 
- Rmarkdown works better in a clean environment.  
- All the variables need to be inside your file.
- This actually assures that your workflow is **reproducible**.

---

## 5.4. Start an Rmd


File>NewFile>RMarkdown <br>

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=500}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"040Rmd.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## 5.5. Rmd parts

Rmd has:
- yaml (including the output)
- chunks 
- plain text
- knit

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=500}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"041Rmd.png?raw=true"))
```


---

## 5.6. Rmd text

You can write plain text in the white area

You can write in: 
- *italics* using one astherics before and one after the word.  
- **bold** using two astheriscs.  
- ***italics and bold*** using three astheriscs.  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"042RmdPlainText.png?raw=true"))
```


More options: [`r fa("external-link-alt", fill = '#e9c46a')`Text in Rmd](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-8.html)

---

## 5.7. Rmd chunk

The parts that are in grey are chunks.  
- The code is written inside three ` at the begginig and at the end and the r between {}
This is because we need to tell which language are we using

- We can run the code using the green arrow that looks like a `r fa("play", fill = '#588157')`, using the button **Run** in the upper part of the code editor, or using **ctrl+enter**.
- The results in Rmd appears in the code editor document, not in the console.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"042RmdChunk.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## 5.7. Rmd chunks

We can add new code chunks using **Ctrl+Alt+I** , the **back ticks** or in the green square with a C in the upper part of the code editor **+**. 


The R code needs to be inside the chunks (the shadowed grey parts) to run.

**Common mistakes are**:
- Not closing the parenthesis **{}**
- Not having the three ` inverted 
- Add code outside the codechunks

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"042RmdChunk.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## 5.8. YAML

YAML means _“YAML Yet Ain’t Markup Language”._ 

By default it will show: title, author, date, **output**.  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"042RmdYaml.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## 5.8. YAML

When you change the YAML, the information that appears in your report will change<br>
If you chnge the output, different type of reports will be generated.

**Common mistakes**  
When you **knit** or render your report, there is something incompatible with Pandoc (or LateX)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"042RmdYaml.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## 5.9. Knitr

There is a botton that says **knit** with a knitting blue ball.
This bottons generates the report.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"042RmdKnit.png?raw=true"))
```

**Note**: every time we knit the changes are saved on our document.


---

## 5.10. Rmd titles

You can use the titles to navigate.

Search for the square with lines (say outline) or click on  **Crtl+Shft+O**.  

This file is very short, but this can be very useful in large documents.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"043Outline.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## 5.10. Rmd titles

Main title use one hashtag #.<br>
- First level #.<br>
- Second level ##.<br>
- Third level ###.<br>

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"044Outline.png?raw=true"))
```

---
name: outputs

## 5.11. Rmd outputs  

The documents can be exported to word, pdf and html.  

Advantages and disadvantages for each one:  

- **word**: easier to share and many journals ask for documents in this format  
- **pdf**: easier to share but not easy to edit  
- **html**: you can include a lot of type of contents `r emo::ji("star")`, but might look unfamiliar   

---

## 5.11. Rmd outputs  

To change the output, you need to change it in the YAML, or chick on the arrow `r fa("sort-down", fill = '#2a9d8f')` in the knit button and chose your format.  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"045Outputs.png?raw=true"))
```

To modify the word format [see here](https://rfortherestofus.com/2020/07/word-reference-documents-rmarkdown/)

## Pause

- Open RStudio `r fa("pencil-alt", fill = '#FFFFFF')` 
- Open a Rmd file (File>NewFile>Rmd)
- Create three different formats: pdf, word and html
- Delete everything except for the YAML (change YAML to your info)
- Add a code chunk
- Add text

Example of code chunk
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
nrow(penguins) #sample size
```


**Note**<br>
Maybe you need to install tinytex<br>
```{r, eval=FALSE}
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

- [`r fa("external-link-alt", fill = '#e9c46a')`What is tiny text?](https://yihui.org/tinytex/)
