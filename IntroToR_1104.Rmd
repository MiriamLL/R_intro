# Lets begging!

---

name: install-r

# 1. Install R

First time installing R

To install R and Rstudio you can visit the page [posit `r fa("external-link-alt", fill = "#f2cc8f")` ](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=280}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"002Posit.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## First time installing R

Once you click download and install R, you will find several links.

If you are the first time installing you likely need to choose the first link.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"003LoadR.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## Update R

If you already have R and R-Studio

Check which version of R you are using:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```

To see if you need to update you can use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("installr")
library(installr)
updateR()
```

<br>

**Do you need an update?**
  
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=150}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"003UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```


---

## Update R

If you opt to update R, one way to do it is going to the [installation page `r fa("external-link-alt", fill = "#f2cc8f")`](https://www.r-project.org/)

You will likely select >4.3 (in 2023)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"004UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## Update R

If you decide to update your R, its better to do it in the Rgui and not R-Studio

.pull-left[
Open Rgui

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=200}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"005UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```
Once in the Rgui, write updateR()

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=200}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"006UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Give it some time

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=200}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"007UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```

]

---

## Update R

Select YES if you already had R packages installed in your previous version, and do not want to install each package one by one again.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=100}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"008UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```

<br>

<br>

By March 2023 4.2.3 was the newest version of R.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=100}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"009UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```


**Did you notice the difference?**

---

## Update R-Studio

One thing is updating R and another one to update R-Studio

If you already have Rstudio and want to see if you need to update you can go to:

.pull-left[
Help>Check for updates

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"010UpdateRStudio.png?raw=true"))
```
]
.pull-right[
If you have an outdated version of R, this would show:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=100}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"011UpdateRStudio.png?raw=true"))
```

Otherwise, it would show that no update is needed.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=100}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"012UpdateR.png?raw=true"))
```

# Parts of R


---

## 2. What is R?

R is a programming language developed for statistical analyses by the Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (New Zealand) in 1996.

### 2.2 Why  R?

.pull-left[
**Advantages**

- Its free

- A lot of tools

- Flexible data visualization

**For science, is reproducible**

- You can save all the steps you followed, making it verifiable 

- Instead of clicking on buttons the instructions can be save in sequence, helping save time and reduce errors


]

--

.pull-right[
**Disadvantages**

- Has a learning curve  

- It is like learning a new language

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height=200}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"014LearningCurve.jpg?raw=true"))
```

]

---

## 2.3. R vs RStudio.

What are the differences between R and RStudio?  

**R** is the programming language.  
**RStudio** is an IDE:  Integrated Development Environment.  

.pull-left[
R is the motor  
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=250}
knitr::include_graphics("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1663581254798-987e1f876ea2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1974&q=80")
```
]

.pull-right[
RStudio is the stirring wheel  
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=250}
knitr::include_graphics("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1667057227564-790470f7a855?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8Mnx8c3RpcnJpbmclMjB3aGVlbHxlbnwwfHwwfHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60")
```
]

---

## 2.4 Using R

First time opening RStudio looks like this:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=350}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"019Rparts.png?raw=true"))
```

To have a code editor:

Open:  
File > New File > Rscript

---

## 2.4. Using RStudio.

In the source section the code can be edited and saved.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=350}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"020Rparts.png?raw=true"))
```

---

## 2.4. Using RStudio.

To change the order of the panes, you can change the pane layout

.pull-left[

Click on the squares>select **Pane Layout...**

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"021PaneLayout.png?raw=true"))
```
]

.pull-right[

Select your preferred order

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"022PaneLayout.png?raw=true"))
```
]

---

## 2.4 Using RStudio

Testing the console

R is like a calculator

- Write in the console
```{r, comment="", eval=FALSE}
3*4
```

- Write in the editor
```{r, comment="", eval=FALSE}
3*4
```

--

In the editor: ctrl + enter

--

- Now write in the editor, dont forget to click ctrl+enter

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Result<-3*4
```

What happend in the **environment**?


---

name: data-types

## 2.5 Data types

Some data types:
- Numeric
```{r, comment=""}
class(1.4)
```

- Characters
```{r, comment=""}
class("Miriam")
```

---

## 2.5. Data types

Why if we use quotes ""?
```{r, comment=""}
class("1")
```

- Logical
```{r}
3 == 4
```

```{r}
3 < 5
```

There are many others, that would be relevant later on.

---

## 2.6. Data frame

Assign symbol

```{r, eval=FALSE}
<-
```

This symbol is frequently use, and is important that you find it in your keyboard as soon as possible. 
 

- Why is not the same as =. See here: [Assignment operators](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1741820/what-are-the-differences-between-and-assignment-operators-in-r), [R inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf), [Why they are not the same](https://www.roelpeters.be/the-difference-between-arrow-and-equals-assignment-in-r/)   

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=200}
knitr::include_graphics('https://www.roelpeters.be/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/APL_KEYBOARD_ARROW_ASSIGNMENT-768x470.jpg')
```
]

---

## 2.6. Data frame

Lets use the arrow symbol.  
```{r}
Names<-c("Miriam","Jette","Kai","Nele","Jana","Kristin","Karena","Nico","Philipp","Mads")
class(Names)
```

```{r}
Names<-as.data.frame(Names)
class(Names)
```

Now in the **environment** click twice and look at your data frame.

---

## 2.6. Data frame

Assign vectors to a column or check a column contents

The symbol $ is in R 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
$
```

Lets create a new column

```{r}
Names$LastName<-c("G","A","T","D","L","S","H",NA,"M","L")
```

```{r, comment=""}
head(Names,5)
```

---

## 2.7. Force classes

Force column type

```{r}
my_number<-'1'
```

```{r}
class(my_number)
```

```{r}
my_number<-as.numeric(my_number)
```

```{r}
class(my_number)
```

---

## 2.7. Force classes

Our favorite class

```{r}
my_timestamp<-'2015-06-12 05:00:00'
```

```{r}
class(my_timestamp)
```

```{r}
my_timestamp <- as.POSIXct(strptime(my_timestamp, "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S "), "GMT")
```

```{r}
class(my_timestamp)
```

Timestamp should be a "POSIXct" "POSIXt" for R to understand the are date and time

---

## 2.8. Code editor

To add text in the **editor** we use the symbol **#** (hashtag)

```{r}
#Here you created a data frame with names, but there is NA
```

R will ignore the text that has a # but these are very important for us to make annotations.

It is a **good practice** to write comments. Either for us to share the script, or for you to remember what you were doing.

This is specially important if you get corrections, or if you want to repeat the analyses.

# Errors

.right[

---

## 2.9. Type of errors

Errors are part of life.  

R very often is trying to tell us how to solve the error.

- For example:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
3 = 4
```
Error in 3 = 4 :left-hand side to assignment (do_set)


Other messages that might be red or orange are:
- Warnings, I will do it, but Im not responsible of what you are doing.
- Messages, hey I just want to let you know this happend.

---

## 2.9. The most common errors

Whats going on here

Remove the # and find the error.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
#c("Miriam","Bety","Angel","Denise""Pamela")
```

--

- Missing a comma

--

```{r}
#c("Alvaro","Gabriela","Juan",,"Lisset")
```

--

- Too many commas

--

```{r}
#c("Majo","Irma","Paulina"
```

--

- Missing a parenthesis

--

```{r}
#c("Majo","Irma,"Paulina")
```

--

- Missing a quote (")

---

## 2.9. Debugging bingo

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(ImageFolder,"023DebuggingBingo.jpg?raw=true"))
```

Source: Dr. Ji Son

---

## 2.4. Object name consistency

Many errors are going to be marked by a red x in the **code editor**.

--

But many will not.

What is wrong with these?
```{r}
#name
```
--

-  If our goal is to use of data frame from the environment it needs to be written exactly the same **Names**.

--

To reduce this source of error, is important to be consitent on how we name the objects.

Some considerations are:

- R will not take objects that start with a number (Eg."1Names").  
- But doesnt have a problem is the name is at the end of the name (Eg."Names1").  

- To be consistent you could use symbols.  
E.g. ("my_names").  
E.g. ("my.names").

# 3. Packages

---

## 3.1. Paquetes

- They are a collection of functions
- They need to be installed one time, but need to be loaded every time you need them.
(you buy the tool box one time but need to bring it to use it)

- To install a package: install.packages("").  
To load a package: library("").  

Another analogy is that install.packages() is downloading an app, and library() is like opening the app everytime you want to use it.

--

In the *console* write:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("cowsay")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("here")
```

`r emo::ji("clock")` Tidyverse is a compilation of packages, this one might take some time.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
Note: It probably will give us a warning, remember that a warning might be just information. In this case is telling us what the package contains.

Another option to install packages is clicking at the **workspace**
Packages>Install>Give the name.

---

## 3.2. Packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}
say(what = "Now you can download packages!", by = "cat")
```

--
nothing happend?
We should load the library first.

--

```{r, comment=""}
library("cowsay")
say(what = "Now you can download packages!", by = "cat")
```


---


## 3.3. Directories

Where are my files?.  

By hand: Click on the **workspace** > Files > Blue symbol > Set As Working directory

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics('https://r4ds-en-espaniol.netlify.app/diagrams_w_text_as_path/es/rstudio-console.svg')
```

However, doing so everytime that we enter R might be time consuming. Therefore, I recommend making it automatically. 

---

## 3.3. Directories
Where I am working?

Option 1
```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("paste your directory name here")
```

Note, that you will need to copy and paste the directory and if you share your script or are working in another computer, everyone will have different directories. 

---

## 3.3. Directories

Where I am?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('here')
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(here)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
here()
```

Advantages:
- Here will use the folder where we saved the script
- You can share your script and your collaborators dont need to copy and paste their directory
- If the folder name is changed or the folder is change from place it would still work

# 4. Read files

---
## 4.1. Intro

A typical R project looks like this:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics('https://r4ds-en-espaniol.netlify.app/diagrams_w_text_as_path/es/data-science.svg')
```
.right[
Fuente: [R4DS](https://r4ds-en-espaniol.netlify.app/)
]

Today we will get to the first part: **load our data**. 


## 4.1. Load data

For this part, we will use functions from the package tidyverse.

Do you already have it installed?

```{r, message="FALSE", warning='FALSE'}
library("tidyverse")
```


Also, I will share with you some files

- Pingus_1.csv
- Pingus_2.csv


---

## 4.1. By hand

You can upload data by hand in your workspace

In the **environment** there is a part that says **import data set**

Select the file **Pingus_1.csv**

--

Another option is to go to the **workspace** 
Files> Click on the file and **import data set**

 
--

Finally, we can do all in the console or script by using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Pingus_csv<-read_csv(here("Pingus_1.csv"))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(Pingus_csv)
```


---

## 4.2. csv format

Now try opening **Pingus_2.csv**  
This file instead of being separated by comas, its separated by colons
Therefore, instead of using **read_csv** we will need to use **read_csv2**

To illustrate this issue, try loading the data using **read_csv**.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Pingus_csv2<-read_csv(here("Pingus_2.csv"))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(Pingus_csv2)
```

Likely it looks very messy...

--


Lets try now with **read_csv2**";"
```{r, eval=FALSE}
Pingus_csv2<-read_csv2(here("Pingus_2.csv"))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(Pingus_csv2)
```

---

## 4.3.  Other formats

Click on the file **Pingus_3.txt**.  
This one is separated by tabs.  
read_tsv is for reading tab separated values.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Pingus_txt<-read_tsv(here("Pingus_3.txt"))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(Pingus_txt)
```

---

## 4.4. Excel format

For loading excel data, there is a special package called **readxl**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("readxl")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Pingus_excel<- read_excel(here("Pingus_4.xlsx"))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(Pingus_excel)
```

There are many other options, let me know if you want to see an example.

---

## 4.5. From an url

Urls (Uniform Resource Locators) or links can also be source of data.

Some examples of webpage that provide data to practice are:  
- [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)  

Let use data from plastic. This data is from 26 January 2021.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plastics <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-01-26/plastics.csv')
```

Look at the first 5 rows of the data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(plastics,5)
```

## 4.6. movebank

There is a package called **move** that can be use to access data stored in movebank.
[move](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/move/vignettes/browseMovebank.html)

To install:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('move')
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(move)
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
movebankLogin()
```

Look at the console now.

---

## 4.6 movebank

It is more convenient to store your login information, but you have to be careful to not share the script with your login information.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
loginStored <- movebankLogin(username="MiriamLerma", password="********")
```

```{r,eval=TRUE}
my_study<-'FTZ UCN Kelp Gull Chile'
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
MyGull<-getMovebankLocationData(study=my_study, 
                               individual_local_identifier="KEGU-noband01-Coquimbo",
                               timestamp_start="202212010000000",
                               timestamp_end="20221205000000000",
                               sensorID="GPS")
```


It might give you a warning, but for now that is not important.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
range(MyGull$timestamp)
```

## 4.7. packages with data

An example is [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
Pingus<-penguins
```

```{r}
head(Pingus)
```

---

## 4.7. packages containing data

However, there are many others.

And they are not limited to data frames.

---

## 4.7. packages containing shapefiles

For example, the package GermanNorthSea
```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MiriamLL/GermanNorthSea")
```

Now the package sf
```{r, message=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
#install.packages('sf')
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(GermanNorthSea)
```

Load and plot some data

```{r}
German_land<-GermanNorthSea::German_land
```

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot()+ geom_sf(data = German_land, colour = 'black', fill = '#ffffbe')+
  coord_sf(xlim = c(3790000,4250000), ylim = c(3350000,3680000),
                    label_axes = list(top = "E", left = "N", bottom = 'E', right='N'))
```


---


## 4.8. many files

There is also a way to load may files the same time  

Example many excel files .xlsx

However, to do this, the name and number of columns should be the same!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
MainFolder<-here()
FilesTracking <- list.files(MainFolder,pattern="*.xlsx",full.names=TRUE)
ListTracking <- lapply(FilesTracking,read_excel)
ListTracking #Te muestra todos los documentos de la carpeta
AllTracks <- do.call("rbind",ListTracking)
```

---

class: inverse

# 4.9. Practice `r fa("pencil-alt", fill = '#FFFFFF')`

Load penguin data  
 Using read_csv <br>
 Using read_csv2 <br>
 Using read_tsv <br>
 Using read_excel <br>

# 5. Rmarkdown

---

## 5.1. RMarkdown 

Rmarkdown is very convenient because it let us export what we do in R to html or word documents.

We can even make slides... <br>
.right[...like this one.]

--

There are **plenty** of options on Rmd. I will just point out a few.

---

## 5.2. Rmd

Markdown is plain text...  
.right[...just as we write in a note block.]

However, the advantages of using Rmd is that you can include a lot of text and thus you can write your **thesis, papers, webpage, books and presentations** without leaving RStudio.

--

Moreover, you can include:  
- code and results that are automatically generated.

---

## 5.2. Rmd

What Rmd does, is that it "translates" what has been written using **PanDoc**.  

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=600}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/61d189fd9cdf955058415d3e1b28dd60e1bd7c9b/b739c/lesson-images/rmarkdownflow.png')
```
]

---


## 5.2. Rmd

We can generate an **output**, that can be read even if you dont have R install.

Just like this presentation.

--

Also, you can get your results without showing the code and without having to copy and paste the results in other program like word.

An example:     

_Here I load my data and check the number of observations_  
```{r}
library(datos)
Pingus<-pinguinos
nrow(Pingus) 
```

---

## 5.2. R vs Rmd

**Considerations:  **  
Rmd behaves differently than R 
- Rmarkdown works better in a clean environment.  
- All the variables need to be inside your file.
- This actually assures that your workflow is **reproducible**

---

## 5.3. Start an Rmd


File>NewFile>RMarkdown <br>
It usually ask for a file name, you can use 'Test_Rmd'

Se vera algo así:  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiriamLL/Curso_CIAD/main/Figuras/RmdNew.JPG')
```

---
name: texto

## 5.3. Rmd parts

Rmd has:
- yaml
- output  
- chunks 
- knit  

---

## 5.3. Rmd parts

### Text

You can write plain text in the white area

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiriamLL/Curso_CIAD/main/Figuras/RmdNew.JPG')
```

If you are doing this at the same time, delete the content in the Rmd file except for the YAML.

---

## 5.3. Rmd parts

### Text

You can write in: 
- *italics* using one astherics before and one after the word.  
- **bold** using two astheriscs.  
- ***italics and bold*** using three astheriscs.   

More options: [`r fa("external-link-alt", fill = ColorLink)`Text in Rmd](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-8.html)

---

## 5.3. Rmd parts

### Chunk

The parts that are in grey are chunks.  
- The code is written inside three ` at the begginig and at the end and the r between {}
This is because we need to tell which language are we using

- We can run the code using the green arrow that looks like a `r fa("play", fill = ColorLink)`, or using the button **Run** in the upper part of the code editor, or using **ctrl+enter**.
- The results in Rmd appears in the code editor document, not in the console.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiriamLL/Curso_CIAD/main/Figuras/RmdNew.JPG')
```

---

## 5.3.Rmd parts

### Chunks

We can add new code chunks using **Ctrl+Alt+I** , the **back ticks** or in the green square with a C in the upper part of the code editor **+**. 


The R code needs to be inside the chunks (the shadowed grey parts) to run.

**Common mistakes are**:
- Not closing the parenthesis **{}**
- Not having the three ` inverted 
- Add code outside the codechunks

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiriamLL/Curso_CIAD/main/Figuras/RmdNew.JPG')
```

---

## 5.3. Rmd parts

### YAML

YAML means _“YAML Yet Ain’t Markup Language”._ 

By default it will show: title, author, date, **output**.  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiriamLL/Curso_CIAD/main/Figuras/YAML.JPG')
```

---

## 5.3. Rmd parts

### YAML

When you change the YAML, the information that appears in your report will change<br>
If you chnge the output, different type of reports will be generated.

**Common mistakes**  
When you **knit** or render your report, there is something incompatible with Pandoc (or LateX)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiriamLL/Curso_CIAD/main/Figuras/YAML.JPG')
```

---

## 5.3. Rmd parts

### Knitr

There is a botton that says **knit** with a knitting blue ball.
This bottons generates the report.

**Note**: every time we knit the changes are saved on our document.
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiriamLL/Curso_CIAD/main/Figuras/knitr.jpg')
```

---

## 5.4. Practice

1. Open RStudio
2. Open a Rmd file (File>NewFile>Rmd)
3. Give a name to the file and write your name 
4. Delete everything except for the YAML (or you can also leave it to see what it generates)
5. Add a code chunk
6. Add text

Remember that you can use the green play button to generate the code and **Ctrl+Alt+I** to create a new code chunk.


---

## 5.4. Practice

For the text:
Add:
'Load penguin data'

In the code part:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(datos)
Pingus<-pinguinos
nrow(Pingus) #sample size
```

Click in knit. You will likely see changes in the terminal.
Wait for your html to be render `r fa("clock", fill = ColorLink)`

---

# 5.5. Rmd titles

Main title use one hashtag #.<br>
- First level #.<br>
- Second level ##.<br>
- Third level ###.<br>

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=350}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiriamLL/Curso_CIAD/main/Figuras/RmdNew.JPG')
```

---

# 5.5. Rmd titles

You can use the titles to navigate

Search for the square with lines (say outline) or click on  **Crtl+Shft+O**.  
Now you could navigate using titles

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiriamLL/Curso_CIAD/main/Figuras/Navegar.JPG')
```

---
name: outputs

# 5.6. Rmd outputs  

The documents can be exported to word, pdf and html.  

Advantages and disadvantages for each one:  

- **word**: easier to share and many journals ask for documents in this format  
- **pdf**: easier to share but not easy to edit  
- **html**: you can include a lot of type of contents `r emo::ji("star")`, but might look unfamiliar   

---

# 5.6. Rmd outputs  

To change the output, you need to change it in the YAML, or chick on the arrow `r fa("sort-down", fill = ColorLink)` in the knit button and chose your format.  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiriamLL/Curso_CIAD/main/Figuras/Outputs.JPG')
```

To modify the word format [see here](https://rfortherestofus.com/2020/07/word-reference-documents-rmarkdown/)


---

# 5.7. Practice

- Add titles and navigate
- Change name and date in the YAML
- Create three different formats: pdf, word and html

**Note**<br>
Maybe you need to install tinytex<br>
```{r, eval=FALSE}
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

- [`r fa("external-link-alt", fill = ColorLink)`What is tiny text?](https://yihui.org/tinytex/)


Remember to add the hashtag to each section, for space between titles use two spaces or < br >
